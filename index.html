      <p class="lead">
        Personal Information is information or an opinion that identifies an individual. Examples of
        Personal Information we collect include: names, addresses, email addresses, phone and
        facsimile numbers.
        This Personal Information is obtained in many ways including email correspondence, telephone
        discussions, information that you enter through our website (www.safeware.com.au) and
        through your subscription to our Airline Integrated Reporting Software (“AIRS”) hosted service.
        This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third party websites or services that you may access
        via links that appear on our website or in any documents or correspondence that you obtain
        from us.
        We collect your Personal Information for the primary purpose of providing our services to you,
        providing information to our clients and marketing to you. We may also use your Personal
        Information for secondary purposes closely related to the primary purpose, in circumstances
        where you would reasonably expect such use or disclosure. You may unsubscribe from our
        mailing/marketing lists at any time by contacting us in writing.
        When we collect Personal Information we will, where appropriate and where possible, explain
        to you why we are collecting the information and how we plan to use it.
